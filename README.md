# FCC-survey
A survey form I created as a project for freecodecamp. I had a few earlier attempts at this that were functional
and could pass the test suites at FCC, but the styling was never very good. This is the example they give to emulate:
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/VPaoNP and after completing a CSS and Sass course I wanted to see if I could do
something similar without looking at the code from the example. I used grid quite a bit which was good practice. I 
chose the color scheme from the KC Chiefs as that seemed to fit the KC themed survey. It was nice seeing how much my
CSS had improved after taking the course. For reference I completed: https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/
and I would definitely recommend it. Having a solid understanding of grid made the layout far easier.
